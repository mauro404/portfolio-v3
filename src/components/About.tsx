            I am enthusiastic about quiz, puzzle and board games - I usually say
            that chess is my first language because I started playing before I
            was alphabetized in my mother tongue - but I never thought that
            something like that could be more than a hobby... until I started
            coding.
          </p>
          <p className="lg:text-base text-sm pb-2">
            With coding I get the same satisfaction that I experience with those
            activities: the process of constantly learning something new, to
            challenge yourself and the rewarding feeling that only something
            demanding can give.
          </p>
          <p className="lg:text-base text-sm pb-6">
            Even though my journey in this field has just begun, I can assure
            that I'm hooked and Iâ€™m here for the long run.
